The resulting loss of valuable ecosystems and their services undermines human well-being and sustainability.

Hawaii is no exception. Coasts are threatened by sediment from former plantations, groundwater discharge laden with nutrients and pathogens, coastal development and hardening, and over use, to name a few. The resulting loss of valuable ecosystems and their services undermines human well-being and sustainability. We need a way to represent the importance of nature for the economy and human activity, so we make informed decisions and avoid unintended trade-offs. That is why we are compiling coastal ecosystem accounts for the state."
